## Getting the repo

When you accepted this assigment, Github Classroom made a repo for you. You want to 'clone' it onto the machine your working on. Here are the steps:

1. ```cd``` into the directory where you want this new repo to live (Desktop is a good place)

4. Run `git clone <pasted url>`
5. cd into the cloned repository
6. Open it in Atom
